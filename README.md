# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).


...until I rewrote a bunch of that stuff, thanks largely to David Katz's class on Udemy (https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-and-redux-mastering-web-apps). 
It's a bit outdated now, but still a good intro to React and web development in general.

This is the code for my website: www.karolcyrklaff.com
I'm using Netlify to host it.
